# HOW ALLIED TESTS DATA

Data testing ensures the accuracy, reliability, and integrity of data. It validates correctness, completeness, consistency, and timeliness. Data testing is crucial for informed decision-making and regulatory compliance. Well tested data is a key for business intelligence, analytics, and reporting.

## REQUIREMENT/DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS

Requirement Analysis:
   * Identify and document business requirements for data integration and testing.
   * Gather input from stakeholders to understand data sources, transformations, and target system expectations.
   * Define data quality criteria, validation rules, and acceptance criteria for testing.
   * Document data mappings, transformations, and business rules to guide testing efforts.
   * Ensure alignment between business requirements and technical implementation.

Documentation Analysis:
   * Review existing documentation, such as data dictionaries, data models, and ETL specifications.
   * Analyze data source schemas, formats, and metadata to understand data structure and semantics.
   * Evaluate data transformation logic, transformation rules, and mappings to target schemas.
   * Identify potential gaps, ambiguities, or inconsistencies in documentation that may impact testing.
   * Update or enhance documentation as needed to reflect changes, requirements, or insights from testing efforts.

## ETL VS ELT TESTING

In summary, the main difference between ETL and ELT testing lies in the timing and location of data transformation: ETL testing focuses on validating transformations before data loading, while ELT testing focuses on validating transformations after data loading. Both approaches are essential for ensuring the accuracy, reliability, and integrity of data integration processes.

## ERROR HANDLING TESTING

  * Evaluate error detection and logging mechanisms.
  * Test error recovery and rollback procedures.
  * Verify error messages and notifications.

## PERFORMANCE AND SCALABILITY TESTING

  * Measure data loading and transformation speeds.
  * Assess system performance under varying data volumes.
  * Test scalability of ETL/ELT processes.

## REGRESSION TESTING AFTER CHANGES OR UPDATES
Regression testing is conducted when there's a need to ensure that  existing functionality remains intact.
Main points here are:

  * Create and maintain a regression tests library (usually it is based on functional tests for previously implemented functionalitis + additions that can cover basics)
  * Validate data consistency and integrity post-updates.
  * Test backward compatibility with existing data and systems.

## TOOLS 

## ENVRONMENTS

  * Establish testing environments that mirror production setups.
  * Ensure availability of test data sets for different scenarios.
  * Consider cloud-based environments for scalability and flexibility.
