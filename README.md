# HOW ALLIED TESTS DATA

Data testing ensures the accuracy, reliability, and integrity of data. It validates correctness, completeness, consistency, and timeliness. Data testing is crucial for informed decision-making and regulatory compliance. Well tested data is a key for business intelligence, analytics, and reporting.

## REQUIREMENT/DOCUMENTATION ANALYSIS

Requirement Analysis:
   * Identify and document business requirements for data integration and testing.
   * Gather input from stakeholders to understand data sources, transformations, and target system expectations.
   * Define data quality criteria, validation rules, and acceptance criteria for testing.
   * Document data mappings, transformations, and business rules to guide testing efforts.
   * Ensure alignment between business requirements and technical implementation.

Documentation Analysis:
   * Review existing documentation, such as data dictionaries, data models, and ETL specifications.
   * Analyze data source schemas, formats, and metadata to understand data structure and semantics.
   * Evaluate data transformation logic, transformation rules, and mappings to target schemas.
   * Identify potential gaps, ambiguities, or inconsistencies in documentation that may impact testing.
   * Update or enhance documentation as needed to reflect changes, requirements, or insights from testing efforts.

## DATA MIGRATION TESTING

## ETL VS ELT TESTING

In summary, the main difference between ETL and ELT testing lies in the timing and location of data transformation: ETL testing focuses on validating transformations before data loading, while ELT testing focuses on validating transformations after data loading. Both approaches are essential for ensuring the accuracy, reliability, and integrity of data integration processes.
